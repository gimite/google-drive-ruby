### Authorization

Follow one of the options in [Authorization](https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/blob/master/doc/authorization.md) to construct a session object. The example code below assumes "On behalf of you" option.

### Example to read/write files in Google Drive

```ruby
require "google_drive"

# Creates a session. This will prompt the credential via command line for the
# first time and save it to config.json file for later usages.
# See this document to learn how to create config.json:
# https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/blob/master/doc/authorization.md
session = GoogleDrive::Session.from_config("config.json")

# Gets list of remote files.
session.files.each do |file|
  p file.title
end

# Uploads a local file.
session.upload_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt", "hello.txt", convert: false)

# Downloads to a local file.
file = session.file_by_title("hello.txt")
file.download_to_file("/path/to/hello.txt")

# Updates content of the remote file.
file.update_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt")
```

### Example to read/write spreadsheets

```ruby
require "google_drive"

# Creates a session. This will prompt the credential via command line for the
# first time and save it to config.json file for later usages.
# See this document to learn how to create config.json:
# https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/blob/master/doc/authorization.md
session = GoogleDrive::Session.from_config("config.json")

# First worksheet of
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg
# Or https://docs.google.com/a/someone.com/spreadsheets/d/pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg/edit?usp=drive_web
ws = session.spreadsheet_by_key("pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg").worksheets[0]

# Gets content of A2 cell.
p ws[2, 1]  #==> "hoge"

# Changes content of cells.
# Changes are not sent to the server until you call ws.save().
ws[2, 1] = "foo"
ws[2, 2] = "bar"
ws.save

# Dumps all cells.
(1..ws.num_rows).each do |row|
  (1..ws.num_cols).each do |col|
    p ws[row, col]
  end
end

# Yet another way to do so.
p ws.rows  #==> [["fuga", ""], ["foo", "bar]]

# Reloads the worksheet to get changes by other clients.
ws.reload
```
