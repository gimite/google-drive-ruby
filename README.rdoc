This is a Ruby library to read/write files/spreadsheets in Google Drive/Docs.

NOTE: This is NOT a library to create Google Drive App.


= Incompatibility introduced in ver. 1.0.0

Ver. 1.0.0 is not 100% backward compatible with 0.3.x. Some methods have been removed. Especially, GoogleDrive.login has been removed, and you must use GoogleDrive.login_with_oauth instead, as in the example code below.

I recommend to switch to the new API. But if you somehow want to continue using the old API, you can keep using it by requiring "google_drive_v0" instead of "google_drive" and use GoogleDriveV0 class instead of GoogleDrive class. It should continue working at least until April 20, 2015 when Google stops support of Documents List API.


= How to install

  $ sudo gem install google_drive


= How to use

First, follow "Create a client ID and client secret" in {this page}[https://developers.google.com/drive/web/auth/web-server] to get a client ID and client secret for OAuth.

Example to read/write files in Google Drive:

  require "google/api_client"
  require "google_drive"

  # Authorizes with OAuth and gets an access token.
  client = Google::APIClient.new
  auth = client.authorization
  auth.client_id = "YOUR CLIENT ID"
  auth.client_secret = "YOUR CLIENT SECRET"
  auth.scope = [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive",
    "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/"
  ]
  auth.redirect_uri = "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"
  print("1. Open this page:\n%s\n\n" % auth.authorization_uri)
  print("2. Enter the authorization code shown in the page: ")
  auth.code = $stdin.gets.chomp
  auth.fetch_access_token!
  access_token = auth.access_token

  # Creates a session.
  session = GoogleDrive.login_with_oauth(access_token)

  # Gets list of remote files.
  session.files.each do |file|
    p file.title
  end

  # Uploads a local file.
  session.upload_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt", "hello.txt", convert: false)

  # Downloads to a local file.
  file = session.file_by_title("hello.txt")
  file.download_to_file("/path/to/hello.txt")

  # Updates content of the remote file.
  file.update_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt")

Example to read/write spreadsheets:

  require "google/api_client"
  require "google_drive"

  # Same as the code above to get access_token...

  # Creates a session.
  session = GoogleDrive.login_with_oauth(access_token)

  # First worksheet of
  # https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg
  ws = session.spreadsheet_by_key("pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg").worksheets[0]

  # Gets content of A2 cell.
  p ws[2, 1]  #==> "hoge"

  # Changes content of cells.
  # Changes are not sent to the server until you call ws.save().
  ws[2, 1] = "foo"
  ws[2, 2] = "bar"
  ws.save

  # Dumps all cells.
  (1..ws.num_rows).each do |row|
    (1..ws.num_cols).each do |col|
      p ws[row, col]
    end
  end

  # Yet another way to do so.
  p ws.rows  #==> [["fuga", ""], ["foo", "bar]]

  # Reloads the worksheet to get changes by other clients.
  ws.reload
